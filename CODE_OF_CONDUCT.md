# Code of conduct

This Repository is for educational purpose. Please be gentle and bear with me if you find my solutions, methods or wording strange. I welcome everyone to submit patches, suggestions, solutions or fork this repo. This project is just about writing a tiny example game in C.

Coding this game was a lot of fun for me, and I think one could code a lot more games like this, like frogger or moon patrol.

It is easy to write down a thousand lines of code, but it it is hard to code clean. I could spend easily a hundred hours on refactoring this. But the final goal is pushing it on <https://f-droid.org/>. I think I need to rename the game and assets for that. But I will go over that bridge when I am there.

Most work was the tutorial itself. It is hard to communicate what one is doing.

Don't be a dick,  
Enjoy and happy hacking!
