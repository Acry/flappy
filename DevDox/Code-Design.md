# Code design in this tutorial

This Code is meant to be read by beginners. There is no real design pattern.
No 'objects' or other fancy stuff, I keep things simple.

- I try to avoid pointer as much as I can.
- The globals are used to make control flow easier.

I may refactor the game, but I think I just go over to the [next](Next.md) parts.
