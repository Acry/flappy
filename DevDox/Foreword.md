# Why would you do that?

In short: Because I want so.

I have been typing game-listings from computer magazines 35 years ago. The art of coding games from scratch should not be something that is in the hand of a few huge corporations. There is more than just using unity, way more.

Linux is an awesome development platform. Compilation of C code is blazing fast on modern platforms. SDL2 is an excellent multi-media framework.

One can build reasonable, modern games with reasonable graphics. I will show that in this series, check out [What is next?](Next.md).

Just pick tiny tasks that one person can handle.

I have seen so many bugs in so called triple A titles that is no even funny. The progress of the gaming industry in the past 20 years is from my point of view relatively slow. Especially when it comes to destructible environments and synthetic sound generation.

Just the graphics resolution and complexity grew, but many fields of game development are not touched.

The reasons for that a numerous. One reason that bugs stay in games forever is the usage of closed source middleware. If you decide to use one, let's say a physics engine, you lose control; you won't be able to fix that one stupid bug. Of course, a company wants to be productive. I know that and I understand that. But... oh well that is a very long story and add my thoughts from time to time.

Current state... there are millions of games. Many of them are make overs. Most are using the same engines or middleware, same selling models (micro-transactions, advertisements, etc.); sometimes the game renderings even look the same.
