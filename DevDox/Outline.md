# Flappy Bird - Implementation

## What this tutorial is about.

Coding a small cross platform game in C from scratch without any prebuilt game engine.

## What this tutorial is not about

- C != C++
- I don't focus on getting started to develop.
- This is not an introduction to the C-Programming language.
- This is not an introduction to SDL2, [check my page for that](https://acry.github.io/c.html).
